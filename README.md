# ComplexityAnalysis
A term project for a Discrete Comp. Structures class, focused on generating 3 different arrays of a user-set size and range. The program then calculates the time required for each sort to finish. The included word document analyzses the differences between the speed of each sort, and the reasons for those differences.
